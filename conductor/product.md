# Product Guide: KnowledgeBase Pro

## 🎯 Overview
**KnowledgeBase Pro** is an AI-powered desktop knowledge management application designed for software developers and content creators. It combines the local-first, privacy-centric philosophy of tools like Obsidian with advanced AI synthesis capabilities, including web-augmented research and multi-document synthesis inspired by NotebookLM.

## 👥 Target Audience
- **Software Developers:** Needing a fast, markdown-based documentation tool that integrates with their local workflows.
- **Content Creators:** Looking for AI-assisted brainstorming, organizing, and synthesis tools to manage complex content pipelines.

## 🚀 Core Goals
- **Local-First Privacy:** Provide a robust alternative to cloud-based apps, ensuring all data and AI operations can remain on the user's machine.
- **Knowledge Discovery:** Enable deep insights through neural linking, bidirectional references, and interactive graph visualizations.
- **Modular Extensibility:** Foster a rich ecosystem via a plugin architecture that allows for custom extensions and integrations.
- **Augmented Intelligence:** Seamlessly integrate AI that not only processes local notes but can also augment knowledge via targeted web searches.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Advanced Markdown Editor:** Professional-grade editor with live preview and bidirectional linking (WikiLinks).
- **Ambient AI Insights:** AI that provides context-aware suggestions and summaries alongside the editor, referencing related notes automatically.
- **Multi-Document Synthesis:** Ability to synthesize information across large collections of notes to generate FAQs, summaries, or study guides.
- **Web-Augmented Research:** AI capability to perform web searches to verify facts or add external knowledge to local research.
- **Neural Linking & Graph:** Automatic relationship mapping between concepts with a D3.js-powered interactive visualization.
- **Lightning Fast Search:** SQLite FTS5 integration for sub-100ms retrieval across thousands of documents.

## 🏁 Success Criteria
- **Performance:** Maintain a <2s startup time and <100ms search latency.
- **Extensibility:** Provide a stable and powerful plugin API for third-party development.
- **Privacy:** Adhere to "Local-First" principles, ensuring AI processing respects user privacy constraints.
